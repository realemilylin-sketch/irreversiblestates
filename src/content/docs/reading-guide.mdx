title: Reading Guide

This site defines irreversible states in real-world processes.

It is not a product site.
It is not a service catalog.
It does not offer solutions.

Readers should proceed in the following order:

1. Foundations — why finality exists
2. Mechanisms — how irreversibility forms
3. Acceptance / Handoff Finality — the canonical definition
4. Reference Case — a single applied instance
5. Toolkit — the output specification only
6. Glossary — controlled terms

This structure is intentional.
