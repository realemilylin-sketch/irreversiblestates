title: Evidence Output Spec (IS-EOS v0.1)
description: A minimal specification for evidence outputs used at dispute nodes.
---

This document defines the **Evidence Output Specification (IS-EOS v0.1)**.

It specifies the **minimum structural requirements** for an evidence output used to support attribution and finality at a dispute node.

The specification is **informative, not normative**.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to define what constitutes a **complete and reviewable evidence output**.

An evidence output conforming to IS-EOS v0.1 is intended to:

- support attribution at a dispute node,
- preserve integrity across handoffs,
- prevent silent alteration or selective presentation.

This specification does not define how evidence is collected or analyzed.

---

## Scope

IS-EOS v0.1 applies to evidence outputs used in:

- acceptance or handoff disputes,
- transitions of custody or responsibility,
- processes where finality depends on documented conditions.

It applies across physical, digital, and procedural contexts.

---

## Conformance

An evidence output **conforms to IS-EOS v0.1** when it includes, at minimum:

- a summary,
- an attachment index,
- an integrity statement,
- a version record.

All components must be present and internally consistent.

---

## Required Components

### Summary

The summary provides a concise description of:

- the dispute node,
- the event or condition being documented,
- the scope of the evidence output.

The summary does not contain conclusions or judgments.

---

### Attachment Index

The attachment index lists all included materials using **immutable identifiers**.

Each entry specifies:

- identifier,
- description,
- creation or capture context.

The index establishes ordering and completeness.

---

### Integrity Statement

The integrity statement describes how evidence integrity is preserved.

It includes:

- handling conditions,
- sealing or protection measures,
- verification or timestamping practices, if applicable.

The statement explains **why the evidence should be considered untampered** within the process.

---

### Version Record

The version record documents:

- creation time,
- release state,
- any subsequent revisions.

The version record prevents silent modification and establishes temporal order.

---

## Assembly Principles

Evidence outputs are assembled according to the following principles:

- completeness over selectivity,
- ordering over aggregation,
- transparency over optimization.

Evidence is evaluated as a **structured output**, not as isolated artifacts.

---

## What This Spec Does Not Do

IS-EOS v0.1 does not:

- prescribe tools, sensors, or detection methods,
- determine legal or evidentiary admissibility,
- assign fault or liability,
- guarantee correctness or truth.

It defines **structure**, not outcome.

---

## Relation to Irreversible States

Evidence outputs conforming to IS-EOS v0.1 support evaluation of **irreversible states** at dispute nodes.

They provide the structural basis upon which finality may be assessed within a process.
