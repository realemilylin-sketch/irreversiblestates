description: A controlled term within the Irreversible States framework.
---

## Definition

**Evidence Finality** is the irreversible state in which an evidence output can no longer be materially altered, substituted, or reinterpreted within the normal process without detection or explicit breach.

## Operational meaning

Once evidence finality is reached, disputes no longer center on what the evidence *is*, but on how responsibility should be assigned given that evidence.

Evidence finality often precedes legal or contractual resolution, but does not require a formal ruling.

## Relationship to Irreversible State

Evidence finality is a specific manifestation of an irreversible state within evidence systems.  
It describes the point at which evidentiary conditions become fixed in practice.

## Not

Not a guarantee of truth.  
Not immunity from all future disputes.  
Not dependent on cryptographic methods alone.
