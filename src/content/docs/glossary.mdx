---

This glossary defines **controlled terms** used throughout the Irreversible States framework.  
Each term has a **single, authoritative definition** within this site.  
Synonyms are intentionally avoided.

---

## Irreversible State

**Definition**  
An **irreversible state** is a condition in which a process, decision, or handoff can no longer be altered, reversed, or meaningfully contested without external intervention.

**Operational meaning**  
Once an irreversible state is reached, responsibility, attribution, or outcome becomes fixed in practice, regardless of later claims or explanations.

**Not**  
Not a moral judgment, not a legal ruling, and not a technical impossibility. It is a process-level condition.

---

## Finality

**Definition**  
**Finality** is the property of a state in which further modification, reinterpretation, or reopening is no longer available within the normal process.

**Operational meaning**  
Finality marks the endpoint at which actions stop producing negotiable outcomes and begin producing binding consequences.

**Not**  
Not permanence in a physical sense, and not immunity from all future disputes.

---

## Acceptance

**Definition**  
**Acceptance** is the act by which a party acknowledges receipt, condition, or completion of an item, service, or obligation.

**Operational meaning**  
Acceptance establishes a reference moment against which later claims are measured.

**Not**  
Not agreement with quality, and not a waiver of all future rights.

---

## Acceptance Finality

**Definition**  
**Acceptance Finality** is the irreversible state created when acceptance has occurred and can no longer be credibly withdrawn within the process.

**Operational meaning**  
After acceptance finality, disputes shift from condition-based claims to responsibility-based claims.

**Not**  
Not a guarantee of correctness, and not proof of absence of defects.

---

## Handoff

**Definition**  
A **handoff** is the transfer of custody, control, or responsibility from one party to another.

**Operational meaning**  
Handoffs define transition points where attribution can change.

**Not**  
Not a shipment event only, and not limited to physical goods.

---

## Handoff Finality

**Definition**  
**Handoff Finality** is the irreversible state in which a transfer of custody or responsibility is completed and cannot be reassigned retroactively.

**Operational meaning**  
Once handoff finality is reached, responsibility is anchored to the receiving side unless independent evidence establishes an earlier breach.

**Not**  
Not a statement of fault, and not dependent on contractual language alone.

---

## Dispute Node

**Definition**  
A **dispute node** is a point in a process where responsibility, attribution, or outcome can be contested.

**Operational meaning**  
Dispute nodes emerge at moments of transition, inspection, or decision-making.

**Not**  
Not every event, and not every disagreement.

---

## Chain-of-Custody (CoC)

**Definition**  
**Chain-of-custody** is the documented sequence of control, handling, and transfer of an item or evidence from origin to final state.

**Operational meaning**  
A continuous chain-of-custody supports attribution and integrity across handoffs.

**Not**  
Not a guarantee of correctness, and not proof of condition by itself.

---

## Evidence Output

**Definition**  
An **evidence output** is a structured collection of materials assembled to support attribution, integrity, and finality at a dispute node.

**Operational meaning**  
Evidence outputs are evaluated as a whole, not as isolated artifacts.

**Not**  
Not raw data, and not informal documentation.

---

## Reference Output

**Definition**  
A **reference output** is a canonical example of an evidence output used to illustrate correct structure and conformance.

**Operational meaning**  
Reference outputs serve as comparative anchors for evaluation and discussion.

**Not**  
Not a template to be filled blindly, and not a legal determination.

---

## Integrity Statement

**Definition**  
An **integrity statement** is a declaration describing how evidence integrity is preserved, including handling, sealing, and verification measures.

**Operational meaning**  
Integrity statements explain why evidence should be considered untampered within the process.

**Not**  
Not a cryptographic proof by default, and not a guarantee against all manipulation.

---

## Version Record

**Definition**  
A **version record** documents the creation, modification history, and release state of an evidence output.

**Operational meaning**  
Version records prevent silent alteration and establish temporal order.

**Not**  
Not a change log of opinions, and not a collaborative edit history.
