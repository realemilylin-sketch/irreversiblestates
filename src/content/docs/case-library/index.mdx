title: Case Library
description: Reference cases illustrating how irreversible states form at dispute nodes.
---

The Case Library contains **reference cases**.

Each case illustrates how an **irreversible state** forms at a specific dispute node under real-world conditions.

Cases are presented to demonstrate **structure and finality**, not to provide advice, remediation, or judgment.

---

## Purpose

Reference cases are used to:

- anchor abstract definitions in observable events,
- demonstrate how acceptance or handoff finality emerges in practice,
- illustrate the minimum evidence required to support attribution.

They are designed to be **canonical**, not exhaustive.

---

## Scope

Cases in this library:

- focus on a single dispute node,
- describe typical failure points,
- reference evidence structure without prescribing tools or solutions.

They are **industry-agnostic** and **process-focused**.

---

## What This Library Is Not

This library does not:

- resolve disputes,
- determine legal outcomes,
- assign fault or liability,
- recommend operational actions.

It documents **where finality forms**, not how disputes should be handled.
