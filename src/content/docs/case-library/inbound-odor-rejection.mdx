title: Inbound Odor Rejection at Receiving
description: A reference case illustrating acceptance finality at receiving.
---

## Scenario

A shipment arrives at a receiving location.  
During initial inspection, an abnormal odor is detected, and the receiving party rejects the shipment on that basis.

The dispute concerns **when the odor condition should be attributed** and **whether responsibility transferred at receiving**.

---

## Dispute Node

The dispute node occurs at the moment of **receiving and inspection**, where acceptance could either occur or be withheld.

This node determines whether **acceptance finality** is reached.

---

## Typical Breakpoints

Common points where attribution fails include:

- absence of a documented odor baseline prior to shipment,
- incomplete chain-of-custody records,
- lack of verified timestamps for inspection,
- ambiguity about whether acceptance occurred before rejection.

---

## Evidence Output (Minimum Set)

The minimum evidence output required to evaluate this dispute node is structured according to **IS-EOS v0.1** and includes the following components.

### Summary

A concise description of:

- the receiving event,
- the detected odor condition,
- whether acceptance was completed or withheld at the dispute node.

The summary does not contain conclusions or fault assignments.

---

### Attachment Index

An attachment index enumerating all included materials using immutable identifiers, such as:

- inspection records at receiving,
- time-stamped photographs or video,
- packaging condition records,
- chain-of-custody documentation.

The index establishes completeness and ordering.

---

### Integrity Statement

An integrity statement describing:

- handling conditions of the shipment at receiving,
- measures taken to preserve evidence integrity,
- verification or timestamping practices, if applicable.

The statement explains why the evidence should be considered untampered **within the process**.

---

### Version Record

A version record documenting:

- creation time of the evidence output,
- release state,
- any subsequent revisions.

The version record prevents silent modification.

---

## Assembly

The evidence output is assembled to:

- preserve integrity across handling,
- document the sequence of events at receiving,
- support attribution relative to the acceptance decision.

Evidence is evaluated as a **structured output**, not as isolated artifacts.

---

## Outcome Framing

If acceptance occurred before the odor condition was documented, **acceptance finality** may have been reached.

If acceptance was withheld and documented at the dispute node, responsibility may remain with the prior custodian.

This framing does not determine correctness or fault; it establishes **where finality forms**.

---

## Conformance

The evidence output described in this case is structured to conform to **Evidence Output Spec (IS-EOS v0.1)**.

---

## Relation to Acceptance / Handoff Finality

This case illustrates how **acceptance finality** can form—or fail to form—at receiving.

The outcome depends on whether acceptance was completed before the odor condition was recorded.

---

## Notes

This reference case is illustrative.  
It does not prescribe inspection methods, detection tools, or legal conclusions.
