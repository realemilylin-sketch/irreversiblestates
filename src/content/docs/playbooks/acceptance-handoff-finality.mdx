title: Acceptance / Handoff Finality
description: The canonical definition of finality at the point of acceptance or handoff.
---

## Definition

**Acceptance / Handoff Finality** is the irreversible state that occurs when acceptance or handoff has taken place and can no longer be credibly withdrawn within the process.

Once this state is reached, responsibility becomes fixed in practice, regardless of subsequent claims or explanations.

---

## Scope

This definition applies to:

- acceptance of goods, services, or deliverables,
- handoff of custody, control, or responsibility,
- any process where attribution depends on a transition point.

It applies across physical, digital, and procedural contexts.

---

## Operational Meaning

Operationally, acceptance or handoff finality marks the moment when:

- the burden of proof shifts,
- disputes move from condition-based claims to responsibility-based claims,
- later evidence is evaluated relative to the accepted or handed-off state.

At this point, **[evidence finality](/glossary/evidence-finality/)** begins to constrain subsequent disputes, as new materials can no longer alter the accepted reference condition without explicit breach.

This moment functions as a **dispute node** with irreversible consequences.

---

## Boundaries

Acceptance / Handoff Finality does not:

- determine **[legal finality](/glossary/legal-finality/)**,
- guarantee correctness or quality,
- establish factual truth,
- assign fault or liability.

It defines a **process-level condition**, not a legal or moral judgment.

---

## Relation to Irreversible States

Acceptance / Handoff Finality is a primary mechanism by which an **irreversible state** is formed within real-world processes.

Once evidence finality is reached following acceptance or handoff, legal finality often follows, even in the absence of a formal ruling.

This transition marks the shift from negotiable outcomes to binding consequences.
