description: Canonical definitions of finality at specific dispute nodes.
---

Playbooks define **canonical forms of finality** at specific dispute nodes.

They do not provide solutions, recommendations, or remediation steps.  
They describe **where finality forms**, not how to avoid or resolve disputes.

Each playbook focuses on a **single irreversible state** that emerges at a well-defined point in a process.

---

## Scope

Playbooks apply to:

- moments of acceptance or handoff,
- transitions of custody or responsibility,
- points where attribution becomes fixed in practice.

They are designed to be **process-agnostic** and **industry-neutral**.

---

## What Playbooks Are Not

Playbooks are not:

- legal determinations,
- quality guarantees,
- operational manuals,
- or dispute resolutions.

They do not assign fault.  
They define **finality conditions**.

---

## Structure

Each playbook provides:

- a canonical definition,
- operational meaning within a process,
- explicit boundaries and exclusions,
- its relation to irreversible states.

This structure is intentional.
